# Netflix Movie and Show Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's vast library of movies and shows. Using SQL and Python, we dive into various aspects such as genre distribution, popular titles, ratings, and content production across different countries. The goal is to uncover insights that can inform content strategy, user preferences, and platform diversity.

## Objectives
- **Genre Distribution**: Understand which genres dominate Netflix's content.
- **Top Rated Titles**: Identify the highest-rated movies and shows based on IMDb and TMDb scores.
- **Content by Country**: Analyze the geographical diversity of Netflix's content.
- **Release Trends**: Track the evolution of Netflix's content releases over the years.
- **Ratings Correlation**: Evaluate the relationship between IMDb scores and TMDb popularity.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on two main tables:
- **Movies and Shows**: Contains information about each title, including genres, release year, ratings, and more.
- **Credits**: Details the cast and crew involved in each title.
